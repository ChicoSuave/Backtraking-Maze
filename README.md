The Haunted but Magical Maze - Solved with Backtracking

The Maze Files and Understanding the Maze Itself:
You are provided a total of 5 text files. Inside each text file is a maze. Here is a sample below.
• The number of rows and columns are all different in each text file, please do not assume they are the same. However, I can assure you that the time limit will 
remain the same for the grading. Meaning, the biggest maze provided will be the same size for when the graders test your code.

• The ‘*’ represents a valid space that Dr. Steinberg can walk on.

• The ‘@’ represents an invalid space that Dr. Steinberg cannot walk on. Think of it as a wall.

• The ‘X’ represents the exit square. This is basically the destination that Dr. Steinberg needs to get to be out of the magical maze.

• Dr. Steinberg can only walk in 4 directions. Up, down, left, and right. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

• The digits such as ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, etc… represent magical squares. These squares will teleport you to other matching digit in the maze. For example, the ‘1’ in the above 
figure, if walked on, will transport you to the other ‘1’. It will NOT transport you to the different digit spots.

• User will always start at the bottom left corner of the maze.
